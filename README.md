### Troubleshooting and documentation
[**Stackoverflow**](http://stackoverflow.com) is a question-and-answer community for developers. Most of the problems you'll encounter have probably been answered there already.

[**The Mozilla Developer Network**](http://developer.mozilla.org) is a wiki-like site with very thorough documentation on web technologies of every kind. If you don't remember the exact syntax of something, just search for it there.

### News and community
One of the best things about web development is that everything (tools, browsers, web standards) keeps improving all the time. This is great because sometimes problems you have just go away because the technology gets better, but it also means that if you want to take advantage of all the new stuff, you'll have to stay up to date and always keep learning. Here are some great ways to keep up with the community:

[**Hacker News**](https://news.ycombinator.com) is *the* news aggregator for the technology industry. It's a community site where people can post and upvote links. It covers a broad range of topics across several disciplines.

[**Designer News**](http://news.layervault.com) is like Hacker News, but much smaller and more focused on design and web development.

[**CSS-Tricks**](http://css-tricks.com) is a website with articles, tips and guides on web design and various related topics.

### Courses and cheat-sheets

[**Code Guide by @mdo**](http://mdo.github.io/code-guide/) is a comprehensive style guide outlining how to structure HTML and CSS.

[**Codecademy**](http://codecademy.com) is an educational site with great interactive development courses.

[**Interactive Typography Tutorial**](http://www.kaikkonendesign.fi/typography/)

[**Flexbox Cheatsheet**](http://apps.workflower.fi/css-cheats/?name=flexbox)

### Other useful sites

[**Codepen**](http://codepen.io/) is an online playground for HTML and CSS. It's prefect for when you just want to try something quickly without having to mess with local files and editors.
